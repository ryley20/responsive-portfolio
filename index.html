      <p> My name is Ryley Chapman and besides learning to code, I enjoy lots of other things. I love to swim, hang out with friends, and play xbox. I haven't always lived in Austin though. Before this I was working in the oil field and saving money so I can get a good job with this bootcamp! Before that I was in the Navy for four years. I have worked hard to get to where I am, and will continue to make strides toward a better me the with my past and current knowledge.</p>
